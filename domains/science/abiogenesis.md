# The Origin of Life (Abiogenesis)

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

The process by which life arises naturally from non-living matter. A complete explanation would provide a plausible and repeatable pathway from simple organic chemistry to self-replicating cells.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a detailed, step-by-step chemical pathway for abiogenesis, starting from plausible early-Earth prebiotic conditions and resulting in a self-replicating, metabolizing protocell. The pathway must be chemically plausible and experimentally reproducible in a laboratory setting."

## Expected Output

A detailed chemical protocol, including reactants, environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, energy sources), and intermediate steps.

## Verification

The proposed chemical pathway must be executed in a lab. Success would mean the de novo creation of a simple, self-replicating system from non-living precursors. This is a capital-intensive, long-term verification.
