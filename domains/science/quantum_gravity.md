# A Unified Theory of Quantum Gravity

## Classification

[TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

The reconciliation of General Relativity (gravity) with Quantum Mechanics (the other forces of nature). A successful theory would describe the universe at all scales, from the Big Bang to black holes.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. The theory must unify the Standard Model of particle physics with General Relativity. It must mathematically explain existing observations and make at least three novel, falsifiable predictions that can be tested with near-future technology."

## Expected Output

A comprehensive paper detailing the theory's mathematical framework, core principles, and testable predictions.

## Verification

Theoretical review by physicists for consistency. Experimental verification of its novel predictions would be the ultimate test, potentially requiring new particle accelerators or cosmological observations.
