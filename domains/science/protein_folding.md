# The Protein Folding Problem (Complete Solution)

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology & [TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

While models like AlphaFold have made extraordinary progress in predicting the final static structure of proteins, a complete solution remains elusive. This includes predicting the folding pathway, the dynamics of the folded state, the structure of multi-protein complexes, and the effects of post-translational modifications from first principles.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a computational method and underlying physical theory that, given any amino acid sequence and its cellular environment, accurately and efficiently predicts: a) its final three-dimensional structure with atomic-level accuracy, b) its dynamic folding pathway, c) its interaction with other proteins and ligands, and d) the functional impact of any mutations. The model must work for intrinsically disordered proteins as well."

## Expected Output

A theoretical paper, a fully documented software package, and its source code.

## Verification

Extensive testing against known protein structures and experimentally observed folding dynamics. The model must outperform all existing methods by a significant margin and successfully predict structures for which no homolog is known.
