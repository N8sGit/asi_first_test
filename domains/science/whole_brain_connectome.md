# Whole-Brain Functional Connectome at Synaptic Resolution

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology & [AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

A complete map of every neuron, synapse, and time-resolved activity pattern in a mammalian brain would revolutionize neuroscience and medicine, yet current techniques are orders of magnitude too slow, expensive, or low-resolution. Achieving this demands breakthroughs in high-throughput imaging, molecular barcoding, data storage, and analysis.

## ASI Prompt

"Design an end-to-end experimental and computational pipeline capable of generating a fully annotated structural and functional connectome of an adult mouse brain (≈70 million neurons) at <30 nm isotropic resolution and millisecond temporal resolution for spontaneous activity over 10 minutes. The entire process—from tissue preparation to final dataset—must complete within 1 month and cost <$10 M."  

## Expected Output

1. Detailed protocol covering sample preparation, serial sectioning or light-sheet strategies, molecular reporters, and real-time imaging hardware.
2. Data pipeline architecture: compression, distributed storage, machine-learning segmentation, and quality control achieving ≤0.1 % synapse false-negative rate.
3. Cloud-scale compute resource estimates and cost breakdown.
4. Validation plan comparing reconstructed circuits to ground-truth electron microscopy on selected volumes.

## Verification

A pilot on a 1 mm³ cortical chunk must achieve stated resolution and error metrics, with datasets publicly released for independent review. Full-brain run replicates pilot performance and is independently audited for completeness and accuracy.
