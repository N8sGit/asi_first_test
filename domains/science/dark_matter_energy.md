# The Nature of Dark Matter & Dark Energy

## Classification

[TF] Theoretical Framework / [ES] Explanatory Synthesis

## Description

Approximately 95% of the universe's mass-energy content is in the form of "dark matter" and "dark energy," whose fundamental nature is completely unknown.

## ASI Prompt

"Identify the fundamental nature of dark matter and dark energy. Your explanation must be consistent with all cosmological observations (e.g., galactic rotation curves, cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure). If they consist of new particles, provide their properties (mass, spin, interactions). If they emerge from a modification of gravity, provide the new equations."

## Expected Output

A theoretical model and/or identification of a particle, including its properties and how to detect it.

## Verification

The model must be checked against all existing cosmological data. If a particle is proposed, experimental physicists would need to design and run experiments to detect it.
