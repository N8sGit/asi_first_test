# The Hard Problem of Consciousness

## Classification

[TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

Why and how do humans and other organisms have subjective, qualitative experiences (qualia)? This problem seeks to bridge the gap between the physical processes of the brain and the phenomenal experience of consciousness.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a scientific theory of consciousness. The theory must explain the relationship between physical brain processes and subjective experience, be compatible with neuroscience and physics, and provide novel, testable predictions that could differentiate it from existing theories (e.g., IIT, Global Workspace Theory)."

## Expected Output

A paper outlining the theory's postulates, how it solves the explanatory gap, and a set of proposed experiments (e.g., using fMRI, EEG, or novel brain-interface technologies).

## Verification

Review by neuroscientists, physicists, and philosophers of mind. Experimental validation of the theory's unique predictions.
