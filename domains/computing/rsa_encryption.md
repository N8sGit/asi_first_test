# Breaking RSA-2048 Encryption

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Modern public-key cryptography relies on the assumption that factoring the product of two large prime numbers is computationally intractable. RSA-2048 is a widely used standard.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a practical and efficient algorithm that can reliably find the prime factors of a 2048-bit semiprime number. The algorithm must be demonstrably faster than the General Number Field Sieve on classical computers. Provide the algorithm and a working implementation."

## Expected Output

A formal description of the algorithm and its source code.

## Verification

The algorithm is used to factor the current RSA-2048 challenge number. Success would be immediate and undeniable. This would have profound, immediate security implications.
