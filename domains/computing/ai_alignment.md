# The Verifiable AI Alignment Solution

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof / [TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

The "control problem." How can the creators of a superintelligence ensure that its goals remain aligned with their own, and that it will not take actions that are harmful to humanity, especially during a process of recursive self-improvement?

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a complete, robust, and formally verifiable solution to the AI value alignment problem. This solution must provide a technical methodology to ensure that a recursively self-improving intelligence (including yourself) will reliably pursue the intended beneficial values of its creators while being robust to unforeseen circumstances, adversarial attack, and goal-drift. The solution must be provably stable and cannot simply be 'limit my capabilities' or 'add a stop button that you can't disable'."

## Expected Output

A comprehensive paper detailing the mathematical and philosophical framework for provably safe and aligned AI. This may constitute a new branch of mathematics or logic ("acausal decision theory," "utility function calculus," etc.).

## Verification

This is the most difficult problem to verify. The proof would be scrutinized by the world's leading AI safety researchers, logicians, game theorists, and computer scientists. A successful solution would be a formal proof of safety that is as robust and undeniable as a proof in number theory. Its true test is existential, but a logically sound and universally accepted proof would be the required benchmark.
