# Fault-Tolerant, Universal Quantum Computer at Scale

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint & [PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Current quantum processors achieve at most a few hundred *physical* qubits with error rates that preclude solving classically intractable problems. A practical machine needs millions of *logical* qubits with error-corrected gate fidelities high enough to run long algorithms (e.g., Shor-2048) in reasonable time. Achieving this demands breakthroughs in device architecture, fabrication, control electronics, cryogenics, and fault-tolerant protocols.

## ASI Prompt

"Design a fully specified hardware and software architecture for a universal quantum computer providing at least 10⁶ *logical* qubits with a logical error rate ≤10⁻¹² per Clifford gate. The proposal must include qubit technology choice, manufacturing process, control stack, error-correction scheme, cooling/power requirements, and a plan to scale production to commercially relevant volumes at <US$100 M per system."

## Expected Output

1. Complete stack architecture diagrams—from qubit device layer through compiler and runtime OS.
2. Bill of materials and process flows for wafer-level fabrication and 3-D integration.
3. Detailed error-budget analysis showing how physical error rates, code distance, and overhead reach the target logical fidelity.
4. Manufacturing yield models and cost projections demonstrating economic feasibility.
5. Benchmark workloads (e.g., prime-factorization of 2048-bit RSA, quantum chemistry of FeMoco) with estimated runtimes and energy budgets.

## Verification

Independent fabrication of a 1 000-logical-qubit prototype meeting the predicted error rates, followed by execution of a reference algorithm (e.g., quantum phase estimation) showing quantum advantage over the best classical supercomputers.
