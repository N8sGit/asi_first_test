# Earth-to-Geostationary Space Elevator

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

A space elevator would provide ultra-low-cost, continuous access from Earth’s surface to geostationary orbit (GEO) without expendable rockets. The primary obstacle is a tether with sufficient specific strength (≥130 GPa·cm³/g) that can be manufactured at scale, plus deployment, power, and safety systems for climbers traversing ~36 000 km.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a complete, end-to-end engineering plan for constructing and operating an Earth-based space elevator capable of lifting 20-ton payloads to GEO at <$100 /kg. The plan must specify:  (1) tether material and industrial production process; (2) orbital deployment sequence and station-keeping; (3) climber design, power-beaming architecture, and throughput; (4) dynamic stability and active vibration damping; (5) failure-mode mitigation and debris avoidance strategies; and (6) economic analysis showing positive ROI within 15 years."  

## Expected Output

1. Materials specification with lab-validated mechanical properties and scalable manufacturing roadmap.
2. Multi-phase deployment timeline, including initial seed ribbon launch and in-orbit spool-out simulations.
3. Structural, thermal, and oscillation analyses demonstrating safe operation under worst-case loading (storms, micrometeoroids).
4. Detailed CAD models of climber vehicles, power-beaming lasers/receivers, anchoring platform, and GEO counterweight station.
5. Cost and risk assessment comparing elevator logistics to state-of-the-art reusable launch systems.

## Verification

Independent materials testing must confirm tether strength and durability. High-fidelity orbital-dynamics simulations and scale prototypes (e.g., kilometer-scale tether tests) must validate deployment and stability models. Economic projections are audited by aerospace and finance experts; full success is proven by constructing and operating a subscale (1 %) demonstrator achieving the target cost per kilogram.
