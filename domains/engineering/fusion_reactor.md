# Net-Positive Energy Nuclear Fusion Reactor

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

The challenge of creating a sustained, controlled nuclear fusion reaction that produces significantly more energy than is required to initiate and maintain it (Q > 10).

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a complete engineering blueprint for a nuclear fusion power plant capable of continuous operation with a Q-factor of at least 30. The design must use existing or near-future materials and technologies, be economically viable, and include detailed plans for construction, operation, safety, and waste handling."

## Expected Output

A full set of CAD files, materials specifications, control system software architecture, physics simulations, and economic analysis.

## Verification

Review by a consortium of plasma physicists and nuclear engineers. The ultimate verification is, of course, the construction and successful operation of a prototype plant based on the blueprint. This is extremely capital-intensive.
