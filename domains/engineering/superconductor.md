# Room-Temperature Superconductor

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint or [PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

The discovery and synthesis of a material that exhibits superconductivity (zero electrical resistance) at or near standard room temperature and pressure.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide the chemical formula and crystal structure for a material that is a superconductor at a temperature of at least 20Â°C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere. Include a detailed, step-by-step synthesis procedure that can be reliably replicated in a standard materials science laboratory."

## Expected Output

A paper detailing the material's composition, structure, and a synthesis protocol.

## Verification

The material must be synthesized by multiple independent labs and its superconductivity (zero resistance and Meissner effect) must be confirmed.
