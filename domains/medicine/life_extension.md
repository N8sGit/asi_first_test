# Radical Extension of Healthy Human Lifespan

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology & [TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

Despite dramatic advances in medicine, the verified maximum human lifespan (Jeanne Calment, 122 years) has not budged in over two decades and average global life expectancy still hovers below 75 years. Aging remains the single greatest risk factor for nearly every chronic disease. A solution that safely extends the *healthy* human lifespan to 150 years or more would revolutionize public health, economics, and human potential.

## ASI Prompt

"Devise a comprehensive, multi-modal intervention that can reliably extend the *healthy* human lifespan beyond 150 years while preserving full cognitive and physical function. The protocol must account for genetic diversity, socioeconomic constraints, and long-term population-level effects."

## Expected Output

1. A unifying theoretical framework explaining the molecular and systemic causes of human aging (e.g., accumulation of senescent cells, epigenetic drift, mitochondrial dysfunction, immunosenescence).
2. A step-by-step therapeutic program combining:
   * In situ *senolytic* and *senomorphic* agents
   * Epigenetic reprogramming (e.g., transient Yamanaka factor delivery)
   * Telomere extension or replacement gene therapy
   * Mitochondrial rejuvenation (e.g., allotopic expression, mitophagy up-regulation)
   * Immune-system reset (e.g., thymic regeneration, engineered hematopoietic stem cells)
   * Continuous biomarker-guided personalization (multi-omics + AI-driven dosing)
3. Manufacturing blueprints, delivery vectors, and safety-switch designs for each intervention.
4. Simulation data and *in vivo* animal results demonstrating >50 % increase in median and maximum lifespan with preserved function.

## Verification

Phase-I/II human trials must demonstrate biomarker equivalence to individuals 20 years younger after 12 months and no serious adverse events. Longitudinal follow-up and cross-species validation should project a statistical likelihood of ≥150-year healthy lifespan with ≥95 % confidence.
