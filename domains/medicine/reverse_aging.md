# Systemic Reversal of Biological Aging

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology & [AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

A therapy that resets the biological (epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional) age of all major tissues in an adult human to that of a healthy 20-year-old, without increasing cancer risk or compromising identity/memory. Unlike merely slowing aging, this requires coordinated rejuvenation at cellular, tissue, and organ-system levels.

## ASI Prompt

"Devise a single-course or short-duration therapeutic regimen that demonstrably rejuvenates human physiology to a youthful state (≈20 years biological age). Provide (1) molecular targets and intervention modalities (e.g., partial reprogramming, senescent cell clearance, mitochondrial replacement), (2) delivery methods and dosing schedules, (3) safety switches to prevent tumorigenesis or loss of cell identity, and (4) validation assays spanning multi-omics clocks and functional performance."

## Expected Output

1. Comprehensive protocol and GMP manufacturing plan covering vector design, small-molecule cocktails, or nanocarrier systems.
2. Preclinical data in aged NHP models showing ≥15-year epigenetic age reversal and restoration of organ function (e.g., VO2 max, immune repertoire diversity).
3. Phase I/II trial design with inclusion criteria, endpoints, and statistical power calculations to detect ≥80 % reversion toward youthful biomarker baselines within 12 months.
4. Economic analysis demonstrating scalability to ≤US$10 k per patient.

## Verification

Clinical trial must show average epigenetic age reduction of ≥20 years across multiple independent clocks and sustained functional rejuvenation (frailty index, cognitive battery) over 5 years post-treatment, with no excess incidence of cancer or adverse events. Independent labs replicate biomarker reversal in treated patient samples.
