# A Complete Cure for HIV/AIDS

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology & [AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

Despite effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV persists via latent reservoirs, necessitating lifelong treatment and causing ~650 000 deaths annually. A true cure requires eliminating or permanently silencing all replication-competent virus without harmful side-effects or viral rebound.

## ASI Prompt

"Develop a safe, single-course therapeutic regimen that results in lifelong eradication of HIV from an infected individual. The protocol must target and eliminate latent reservoirs in all tissue compartments or render them permanently non-replicative, with no off-target genome edits. Provide manufacturing, delivery, and monitoring plans applicable across HIV subtypes."

## Expected Output

1. Molecular design of curative agents (e.g., CRISPR/Cas gene editors, latency-reversing drugs, broadly neutralizing antibody–based CAR-T cells) including sequences and delivery vectors.
2. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrating ≥99.999 % reduction of proviral DNA and complete absence of viral rebound in humanized-mouse or NHP models over 2 years.
3. Step-by-step clinical protocol, GMP manufacturing blueprint, and safety switch mechanisms.
4. Cost and access strategy enabling global deployment (<US$1000 per patient). 

## Verification

Phase I/II trials must show complete plasma and tissue viral clearance (PCR < 1 copy/10⁶ cells) and no rebound after 3 years without ART. Independent labs must replicate reservoir elimination in ex-vivo patient samples. Long-term follow-up confirms durable cure and absence of off-target genomic effects.
