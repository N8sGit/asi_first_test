# A Universal Cancer Therapy Framework

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Cancer is a complex and diverse family of diseases characterized by genomic instability. A "single cure" is unlikely; what is needed is a methodology that can reliably defeat any malignancy.

## ASI Prompt

"Design a therapeutic platform and methodology that, given the genomic and proteomic data from a patient's specific malignancy, can generate a personalized treatment that leads to complete remission with minimal off-target effects. This platform must be robust enough to handle tumor heterogeneity and evolving resistance."

## Expected Output

A framework detailing the process: from biopsy analysis to the design of a targeted agent (e.g., a custom mRNA vaccine, a set of small-molecule inhibitors, or an engineered viral/nanoparticle delivery system) and a protocol for its synthesis and administration.

## Verification

Pre-clinical trials followed by successful Phase I-III human clinical trials on a range of difficult-to-treat cancers (e.g., glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer).
