# Halting and Reversing Neurodegeneration

## Classification

[TF] Theoretical Framework & [PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons. Their root cause is not fully understood, and treatments are symptomatic at best.

## ASI Prompt

"Identify the root causal mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. Based on this mechanism, develop a therapeutic intervention that can verifiably halt the progression of neurodegeneration and restore lost cognitive function in early-to-mid-stage patients."

## Expected Output

A comprehensive theory of the disease's etiology and a full therapeutic protocol, including the molecular design of any new drugs and the results of simulated trials.

## Verification

The theory must explain all known genetic and clinical features of the disease. The therapy must be proven safe and effective in extensive, placebo-controlled human trials.
