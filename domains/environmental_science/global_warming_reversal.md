# Global Warming Reversal: Restoring Pre-Industrial Climate

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint & [PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Mitigating emissions is no longer enough—global mean surface temperature has already risen ~1.2 °C above pre-industrial levels with cascading impacts on ecosystems and human societies. The challenge is to develop and implement a coordinated suite of interventions that not only halt warming but actively restore the climate to ≤0.5 °C above pre-industrial baseline within this century, while minimizing ecological side-effects and geopolitical risk.

## ASI Prompt

"Develop a comprehensive, globally deployable strategy that will reduce the planet’s radiative forcing sufficiently to return the 10-year averaged global mean surface temperature to within 0.5 °C of the 1850–1900 baseline by 2100. The proposal must integrate: (1) gigaton-scale atmospheric greenhouse-gas removal pathways, (2) sunlight-reflection methods (e.g., stratospheric aerosols or marine cloud brightening) with adaptive control, (3) rapid decarbonization of remaining energy and industrial systems, and (4) international governance mechanisms ensuring equitable implementation and monitoring. Provide detailed engineering designs, deployment timelines, risk assessments, and cost analyses."

## Expected Output

1. Quantitative climate-model simulations (CMIP-class) showing temperature trajectory, precipitation patterns, and uncertainty bounds with and without interventions.
2. Techno-economic models detailing capital and operating costs for each intervention, totalling ≤2 % of projected global GDP.
3. Lifecycle analyses demonstrating net-negative greenhouse-gas balance (>20 Gt CO₂-eq removed per year by 2050) and minimal non-CO₂ environmental impacts.
4. A governance and verification framework outlining data-sharing, liability, and compensation mechanisms, enforceable under existing international treaties.

## Verification

Independent climate-model intercomparison must reproduce projected temperature reversal. Pilot deployments (e.g., 1 Mt CO₂-eq removal plant, limited-area cloud-brightening trials) must confirm modeled efficacy and side-effect profiles. Success is ultimately measured by observed downward trend in global mean temperature consistent with model predictions.
