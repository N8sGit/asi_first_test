# Global Plastic Waste Elimination

## Classification

[PM] Process/Methodology

## Description

Micro- and macro-plastics have polluted every environment on Earth. A solution requires a method to break down existing, highly durable polymers (like PET, HDPE) back into benign or valuable base components.

## ASI Prompt

"Design a self-replicating biological or self-assembling catalytic system that can be deployed in oceans and landfills to safely and efficiently break down the ten most common forms of waste plastic into non-toxic, environmentally harmless substances."

## Expected Output

The genetic code for a novel microorganism or the chemical blueprint for a nanocatalyst, along with a deployment strategy and ecological safety analysis.

## Verification

Lab demonstration of the process, followed by contained field trials to prove its efficacy and ensure it has no negative ecological side effects (e.g., does not attack non-target materials).
