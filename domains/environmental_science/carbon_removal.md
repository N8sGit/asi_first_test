# Economical Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal at Scale

## Classification

[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint

## Description

While various direct air capture (DAC) technologies exist, they are currently too expensive and energy-intensive to be deployed at the planetary scale needed to reverse climate change.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide the complete design for a process and facility to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at the gigaton-per-year scale. The process must be net-carbon-negative (including construction and energy inputs), economically viable without subsidy (i.e., the sequestered carbon or a byproduct has value), and ecologically benign."

## Expected Output

Full engineering blueprints, chemical process diagrams, land-use plans, and a complete economic and life-cycle analysis.

## Verification

Review by chemical engineers, climate scientists, and economists. Successful operation of a pilot plant demonstrating the claimed efficiency and cost.
