# A Stable and Optimal System of Governance

## Classification

[TF] Theoretical Framework

## Description

A long-standing problem in political philosophy and social science is designing a system of governance that durably maximizes human well-being, freedom, and fairness while remaining stable against corruption, factionalism, and external shocks.

## ASI Prompt

"Design a new system of governance and social organization. The system must be specified in a constitution-like document and supported by a multi-agent simulation demonstrating its long-term stability and superiority to existing systems (e.g., liberal democracy, authoritarianism) across key metrics (e.g., median quality of life, Gini coefficient, technological progress, existential risk mitigation). The framework must include mechanisms for its own amendment and adaptation."

## Expected Output

A detailed document describing the system's principles, laws, and institutions, along with the source code and results of the validating simulation.

## Verification

Review by political scientists, economists, sociologists, and legal scholars. The ultimate test would be a small-scale, voluntary implementation, though this is fraught with ethical and practical challenges. The strength of the simulation would be the primary verification medium.
