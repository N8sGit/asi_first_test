# The ABC Conjecture

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof

## Description

A deep conjecture in number theory relating the prime factors of two integers, $a$ and $b$, to the prime factors of their sum, $c=a+b$. A proof would have sweeping implications for Diophantine equations. A proposed proof in the 2010s remains contested and not widely understood.

## ASI Prompt

"Provide a clear, universally understandable, and formally correct proof of the ABC conjecture. The proof's steps and logic must be readily verifiable by the global mathematics community."

## Expected Output

A formal proof, potentially with new mathematical formalisms if required, but presented with a clear bridge from existing mathematics.

## Verification

Widespread acceptance by leading mathematicians, resolving the current controversy and demonstrating an ability not just to solve, but to communicate complex solutions effectively.
