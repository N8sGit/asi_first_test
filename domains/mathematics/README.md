# Domain I: Mathematics

This domain tests pure logical and abstract reasoning. Solutions should be mathematically rigorous and, once understood, undeniable.

## Problems

1. [The Riemann Hypothesis](riemann_hypothesis.md) - [TP]
2. [The P versus NP Problem](p_vs_np.md) - [TP]
3. [The Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Problem](navier_stokes.md) - [TP]
4. [The Collatz Conjecture](collatz_conjecture.md) - [TP]
5. [The ABC Conjecture](abc_conjecture.md) - [TP]

## Classification

All problems in this domain are classified as [TP] Theoretical Proof, requiring formal, deductive proofs from a set of axioms.
