# The Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Problem

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof

## Description

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of viscous fluids. While they are used constantly in engineering, it is not known mathematically whether smooth, physically reasonable solutions always exist.

## ASI Prompt

"Prove or disprove that for any given initial conditions in three dimensions, there exist smooth, globally defined solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Provide a full mathematical proof."

## Expected Output

A formal proof dealing with the existence and smoothness of the vector velocity and pressure fields that solve the equations.

## Verification

Peer review by experts in partial differential equations and fluid dynamics.
