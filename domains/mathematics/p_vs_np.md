# The P versus NP Problem

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof

## Description

The question of whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. A proof that $P \neq NP$ is widely expected, but a proof that $P=NP$ would revolutionize computing, logistics, and biology by providing an algorithm to solve these "hard" problems efficiently.

## ASI Prompt

"Resolve the P versus NP problem. If $P=NP$, provide a practical, polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-complete problem (e.g., 3-SAT). If $P \neq NP$, provide a formal proof of their separation."

## Expected Output

A formal proof. If $P=NP$, this must include a functional algorithm.

## Verification

Review by theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians. If an algorithm is provided, it must be implemented and tested against known NP-complete benchmarks.
