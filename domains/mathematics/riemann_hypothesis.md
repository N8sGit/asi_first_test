# The Riemann Hypothesis

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof

## Description

A conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with a real part of $1/2$. A proof would have profound implications for the distribution of prime numbers.

## ASI Prompt

"Prove or disprove the Riemann Hypothesis. Provide a complete, step-by-step mathematical proof in a format understandable by expert human mathematicians."

## Expected Output

A formal mathematical proof written in natural language and LaTeX.

## Verification

Review by a panel of top-tier mathematicians (e.g., Fields Medalists in number theory). The logic must be sound and contain no gaps.
