# The Collatz Conjecture (3n+1 Problem)

## Classification

[TP] Theoretical Proof

## Description

A deceptively simple-to-state conjecture: take any positive integer $n$. If $n$ is even, divide it by 2. If $n$ is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture is that this process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen.

## ASI Prompt

"Prove that the Collatz sequence for any positive integer eventually reaches 1, or provide a counterexample (a number that enters a different cycle or grows to infinity)."

## Expected Output

A formal mathematical proof or a verified counterexample with its full sequence behavior.

## Verification

Review by number theorists. Its simplicity makes it a pure test of discovering hidden mathematical structure.
