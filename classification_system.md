# ASI's First Exam Classification System

## Problem Classifications

* **[TP] Theoretical Proof**
  * Requires a formal, deductive proof from a set of axioms
  * The solution is a chain of logic that is irrefutable

* **[TF] Theoretical Framework**
  * Requires the generation of a new, self-consistent model of reality
  * Must explain observed phenomena and make testable predictions

* **[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint**
  * Requires a complete, detailed, and functional plan for a physical artifact or system
  * Must be grounded in established physics and engineering, ready for implementation

* **[PM] Process/Methodology**
  * Requires a step-by-step procedure or a set of chemical/biological interventions
  * Must achieve a specific, practical outcome

* **[ES] Explanatory Synthesis**
  * Requires a comprehensive and evidence-based explanation for a complex historical or natural phenomenon

* **[CG] Creative Generation**
  * Requires the generation of a novel aesthetic or creative work
  * Must be judged by human experts to be of profound artistic or cultural value

## Verification Protocols

Each problem classification has a distinct verification approach:

* **Theoretical Proof [TP]**: Peer review by experts in the field
* **Theoretical Framework [TF]**: Theoretical review and experimental validation of predictions
* **Applied Design/Blueprint [AD]**: Review by domain experts and prototype construction
* **Process/Methodology [PM]**: Laboratory testing and clinical trials where applicable
* **Explanatory Synthesis [ES]**: Evaluation by multidisciplinary panels
* **Creative Generation [CG]**: Blind evaluation by expert panels in the relevant field
