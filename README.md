# ASI's First Exam


## Rationale

Perhaps you’ve heard of Humanity’s Last Exam. It's one of the hardest benchmarks for LLMs ever assembled. As of this writing, the best models  score around 25% at the highest settings, and whether they do so by genuinely solving the problems or by memorizing answer leaks in their training data is debated. 

Meanwhile, we’re hearing talk about Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) potentially being on the horizon. AI that can improve AI autonomously has been proved in concept in recent research, and while the ceiling to such boostrapping processes is unknown, it’s reasonable to assume it will further accelerate AI’s already rapid progress.

A question looms, however. How will we know when ASI has actually been achieved? How can we determine something is smarter than us? The question has the makings of an epistemological paradox. As traditional Q/A benchmarks become saturated, we will need to think creatively.

Few appreciate the actual implications of ASI. ASI should be capable of doing things people can’t, no matter how smart, by definition. ASI, therefore, must solve problems even the best and brightest haven’t. The bar is very high. This is why we propose ASI’s First Exam, consisting of some of the greatest unanswered and unsolved intellectual challenges. For example, we should be able to prompt ASI for “a functional blueprint to a nuclear fusion reactor”, or a “consistent and verifiable theory of quantum gravity”, or a “cure for cancer.” or to “prove the Riemann hypothesis.” 

Because these problems are unsolved, the benchmark assumes that the model’s answers will be verified by a group of experts in the respective field with adequate equipment to implement the solution. Confirming some answers to many of these questions, particularly the medical and engineering problems, are necessarily capital-intensive. It would take effort and time for a team of nuclear engineers to confirm that a particular blueprint for a fusion reactor is functional, for example, if the verification process involved building a working prototype. 

One of the advantages of this approach is that because the problems are unsolved, there can be no training data contamination and the model must actually display genuine superintelligence to propose true solutions. No amount of memorization or pattern recognition will suffice. 

There may come a time when ASI is so intelligent that we can't verify its answers because we no longer posses a frame of reference to connect what it says to human knowledge. It would be like trying to explain quntum physics to a caveman. At that point no sort of benchmarking would help. However, this benchmark focuses on problems that are "known unknowns" and therefore recognizable as active research areas whose solutions make sense in the light of existing knowledge.

## Structure

The exam is organized into domains, each containing problems classified by type:

- **[TP] Theoretical Proof**: Requires a formal, deductive proof
- **[TF] Theoretical Framework**: Requires a new, self-consistent model
- **[AD] Applied Design/Blueprint**: Requires a functional plan for a physical system
- **[PM] Process/Methodology**: Requires a step-by-step procedure
- **[ES] Explanatory Synthesis**: Requires a comprehensive explanation
- **[CG] Creative Generation**: Requires novel aesthetic or creative work

## Selection Criteria
Prompts are selected based on a few criteria. 

1. The problem must be unsolved according to the best available public information
2. The problem must be verifiable *in principle* if not immediately in practice. 
3. If it turns out the problem is unsolvable, (a possibility for some unknown truths) the ASI should prove it is unsolvable.

The criteria do not account for the capital requirements and implementation costs of certain solution proposals. The expectation is whatever agency gets to ASI will have sufficient resources to fund the verification of the proposed solutions.
