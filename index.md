# ASI's First Exam: A Benchmark for Superintelligence

## Preamble

The following problems represent some of the most profound and persistent intellectual challenges in human history. They are unsolved not for a lack of effort, but because they appear to be at or beyond the current limits of human cognition, collaboration, and technology. An Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) should be capable of providing solutions that are not only novel but also verifiable and demonstrably correct.
